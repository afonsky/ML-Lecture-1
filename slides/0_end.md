# Conclusions

* You have started training on our machine learning course, where we discuss:
  * Statistical learning methods are widely useful across academic and non-academic fields
  * Contemporary methods will become as common as classical tools (e.g., linear regression)
  * Avoid treating methods as black boxes
  * No single method works best for all problems
  * Explain model, intuition, assumptions, and trade-offs for each method
  * Emphasize practical application to real-world problems
* Good luck!
